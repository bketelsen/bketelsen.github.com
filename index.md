I am the CIO at a credit bureau focusing on sub-prime consumers, where I use a wide variety of cutting edge technologies to provide real-time credit and risk data to lenders.  I once created RailsLiveCD, a popular Linux distribution that distributed a self-contained Rails development environment.  I have authored or co-authored many open source libraries for Ruby and Go, including Skynet - a popular distributed application framework written in Go, and have spoken about Go at conferences like Strangeloop.
